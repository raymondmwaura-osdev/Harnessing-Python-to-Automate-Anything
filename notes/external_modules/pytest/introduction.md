# Introduction to pytest

## What is pytest

The framework known as pytest is an open-source testing tool for the Python programming language. It is designed to enable developers to write test code in a concise and readable manner, yet it is fully capable of scaling to complex testing scenarios (such as functional, integration or end-to-end tests) when needed.

Some of pytest’s distinguishing attributes include:

* **Automatic test discovery**: pytest automatically finds test modules and functions following naming conventions (for example filenames beginning with `test_` or ending with `_test.py`).
* **Expressive syntax**: Developers write simple Python functions and `assert` statements rather than needing verbose boilerplate code.
* **Extensibility**: A strong ecosystem of plugins and extensions supports advanced features, such as fixtures for setup/teardown, parameterised testing, and rich reports.

## Why pytest matters

Selecting the right testing framework is a pragmatic choice in software development, and pytest matters because it brings several practical benefits to the table:

* **Reduces friction for writing tests**: Because pytest allows straightforward test definitions and fewer constraints, more tests tend to get written, increasing code-coverage and quality.
* **Improves readability and maintainability**: Test code written with pytest tends to be shorter and easier to understand, which makes maintaining tests alongside evolving code simpler.
* **Supports scalability**: As projects grow in size or complexity, pytest’s features (fixtures, parametrisation, plugins) help maintain a manageable test suite rather than letting testing become a bottleneck.
* **Integrates with workflow and tools**: pytest works with various development workflows, continuous integration systems, and can integrate with other testing styles or legacy tests.

## How to install pytest

Before writing tests, you must install pytest in your Python environment. The following subsections describe the typical installation process and some recommended practices.

### Pre-requisites

* Ensure you have a compatible version of Python. For recent pytest releases, this means Python 3.7 or newer (or PyPy3).
* It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment (such as `venv`, `virtualenv`, or Conda) to isolate your testing dependencies from global Python packages; this avoids version conflicts and enhances reproducibility.

### Installation via pip

Once a virtual environment is activated, install pytest with the following command:

```bash
pip install -U pytest
```

The `-U` flag ensures you install or upgrade to the most recent version available.

### Verifying the installation

After installation completes, verify pytest is available and determine its version by running:

```bash
pytest --version
```

The command will report the pytest version and the path from which it is imported.

### Installation via alternative managers

If you prefer Conda or another package manager, pytest is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and commonly via conda-forge. For example:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pytest
```

### Additional environment considerations

* On some systems, especially Windows, you may need to ensure the `Scripts` directory of the virtual environment is in your `PATH`, so that the `pytest` command is recognised.
* If you have multiple Python versions installed, ensure you are installing pytest into the correct version (e.g., `python3 -m pip install pytest`).
