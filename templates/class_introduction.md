* Include the signature format (without method internals).

  ```python
  class ClassName(BaseClass):
  ```

* Note inheritance if applicable.

---

## Instantiation

* Explain how to create an instance of the class.

  ```

  * Highlight typical use cases for instantiation.
  * Mention default behaviors or typical contexts.

---

## Usage Context
