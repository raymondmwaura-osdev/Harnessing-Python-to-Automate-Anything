# Python Insights

This repository does not contain exhaustive notes on Python. Instead, it contains insights from my experience using Python. The insights include the most efficient way to do things, which libraries are best for which tasks, which libraries and behavior to avoid, sometimes some notes on important things I may forget.

Feel free to open an issue if you find incorrect or outdated information.
